# 3D_Minesweeper
Are you feeling bored only playing too much 2D minesweeper? <br>
Are you tired of the game being a flat object?<br>
Are you thinking that you are a master of the game already?

You can think otherwise with this new implementation of a 3D minesweeper!

This will be made fully with python, with python libraries used to build the application



## Features
1. Instead of having 8 sides for every tile, there is now up 26 sides that can possibly have a mine with every open square (or is it a cube)
2. You can rotate the block and zoom into each layers, uncovering more and more mines as you do so!



## Controls
WASDRF keys to move the 3D cube to different orientation
- W to flip forwards
- A to flip leftwards
- S to flip backwards
- D to flip rightwards
- R to turn rightwards
- F to turn leftwards

Arrow keys to switch between the layers of the 3D cube
- Upper arrow key to move upwards
- Lower arrow key to move downwards

Clicking
- Left click to reveal cell(s)
- Right click to flag cell(s)
