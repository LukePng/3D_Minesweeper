# 3D_Minesweeper
Are you feeling bored only playing too much 2D minesweeper? <br>
Are you tired of the game being a flat object?<br>
Are you thinking that you are a master of the game already?

You can think otherwise with this new implementation of a 3D minesweeper!

This will be made fully with python, with python libraries used to build the application

TBC soon!

## Features
1. Instead of having 8 sides for every tile, there is now up 26 sides that can possibly have a mine with every open square (or is it a cube)
2. You can rotate the block and zoom into each layers, uncovering more and more mines as you do so!



## Future projects
- 4D Minesweeper
- Other polygonal Minesweeper
